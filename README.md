# Bartosz Litwa Portfolio

Public portfolio at [litwa.dev](https://litwa.dev), implemented as a static React single-page
application. The repository supports GitHub Pages and a Docker/Nginx deployment behind Traefik.

## Architecture

The executable system in this repository is frontend-only:

```text
Browser
  -> GitHub Pages, or Traefik -> Nginx container
      -> static Vite build
          -> React 19 + TypeScript
              -> JSON content in src/data
              -> bundled images and fonts
              -> localStorage: language and theme preferences
              -> Umami: anonymous product analytics
              -> remote icon/badge image hosts
```

There is no first-party backend, API, authentication/authorization service, database, migration
system, or native mobile app here. Technology names in portfolio content describe other projects.

Main runtime components:

- `src/App.tsx`: composition, code splitting, and analytics section observation
- `src/components`: navigation, hero, experience, skills, projects, certifications, and footer
- `src/data`: portfolio and EN/PL translation data
- `src/hooks`: language, theme, and intersection-based animation state
- `src/utils`: asset lookup, localization, and Umami helpers
- `vite.config.ts`: build, test, coverage, and output configuration
- `nginx.conf`: SPA routing and cache policy
- `nginx-security-headers.conf`: Docker response-header baseline and CSP
- `compose`: Dokploy/Traefik service configuration

## Requirements and local setup

- Node.js 22 through 24
- npm 10 or newer
- Docker with Compose v2 only for container validation/deployment

Install exactly what is recorded in the lockfile and start Vite:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Vite prefers `http://localhost:3000` and selects the next available port if 3000 is occupied.

## Configuration and secrets

No secret or environment variable is required. Umami's website ID is public telemetry configuration
in `index.html`. Every future variable prefixed with `VITE_` would be embedded into browser
JavaScript and public; never put a private API key, token, password, or server credential in a Vite
environment variable or in Compose build arguments.

## Quality and security gates

Run the complete local gate before every release:

```bash
npm run check
```

It enforces formatting, ESLint, strict TypeScript, Vitest coverage thresholds, a production build,
and an audit that explicitly includes development/build dependencies. Individual commands remain
available as `npm run format:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:coverage`,
`npm run build`, and `npm run audit`.

GitHub Actions runs the same gate and additionally builds the production container. Dependabot
checks npm, Docker base images, and GitHub Actions weekly.

## Deployment and operations

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for GitHub Pages and Docker/Traefik procedures, health checks,
rollback steps, headers, logging, and operational checks. Use [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)
for each release.

The Docker path provides:

- immutable, digest-pinned Node and Nginx base images
- permanent HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect at Traefik
- HSTS, CSP, clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, referrer, and browser-permission headers
- immutable caching for fingerprinted assets, including WebP, and no-cache HTML
- read-only container filesystem, localhost-only host-port binding, resource limits, health checks,
  and log rotation

GitHub Pages does not allow this repository to set arbitrary HTTP response headers. If Pages remains
a production target, configure equivalent headers at its CDN/front door and verify them after DNS or
hosting changes.

## Security and privacy

- The site is public and has no accounts, roles, sessions, or private application records.
- React escapes rendered JSON content; no raw HTML injection API is used.
- External links opened in a new tab use `noopener noreferrer`.
- Third-party analytics and image hosts remain availability, privacy, and supply-chain dependencies.
- Client errors currently fall back to a root error boundary and console logging; there is no remote
  error collection or uptime alert in this repository.
- Report vulnerabilities according to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Known issues and recommended follow-up

The full prioritized register, evidence, fixes, and accepted constraints are in
[ANALYSIS.md](ANALYSIS.md). The main remaining work is:

1. choose and document one authoritative production deployment path;
2. add independent uptime and client-error monitoring with redaction/retention rules;
3. self-host or explicitly govern remote icons/badges and define a privacy notice for analytics;
4. consolidate the duplicate Compose files and clean unused source assets;
5. expand behavior and accessibility coverage beyond the current regression floor.

## Updating content

Most content changes belong in:

- `src/data/projects.json`
- `src/data/experience.json`
- `src/data/skills.json`
- `src/data/certifications.json`
- `src/data/translations.json`

Keep EN and PL translation structures aligned. The test suite validates translation paths, unique
content identifiers, project links, and required collections.
